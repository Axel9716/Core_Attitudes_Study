# Abstract

Over the last two decades, the U.S has experienced a 36% decline in religious participation, based on Gallup surveys. In a similar period of time, the U.S. has experienced other nation-wide phenomena, including the advent of cell phones and social media, which increasingly permeates our everyday life. Clergy leaders should understand what factors are impacting the decline in religious participation, if they wish to rebuild membership. In this report, I use survey response data from the World Values Survey (WVS) to analyze the approval of science and technology, economic outlook, and their association with religion. I use two questions from the WVS data as a proxy for these affinities, which effectively ask: **"If developments in science/technology change our way of life, would that be good or bad?"**, **"How do you rate the economy?"**, and **"Do you consider yourself religious"**. The groups are simply labelled: **{science: "good", "bad"}**, **{economy: "positive", "negative"}**, and **religious: "yes", "no"}**. Within the *"science bad"* group, 61% are religious, and in the *"science good"* group, 52% are religious. I used the `infer` package to generate sampling distributions of two proportions and conduct 2-proportion z-tests, with the significance level for the null hypotheses set at 0.05. The test for religion and science/technology resulted in a p-value of 0.036, which is less than our significance level, so we reject the null hypothesis. The test for religion and economic outlook generated a p-value of 0.986, so we fail to reject the null. These findings provides evidence that clergy leaders will likely have more success building religious membership in communities with less approval of science/technology. Whereas, targeting communities based on economic factors may not sway the likelihood of success. Furthermore, I would recommend clergy leaders improve religious membership in communities with higher science/technology approval, by educating communities on the positive influences religion and science/technology have had on each other throughout history, to increase religious relevance in a constantly evolving technological world.


# Introduction

The motivation for the project comes from an interest in the decline rates of religious participation in the U.S. As someone who was raised Catholic in the 21st century, I have seen firsthand the decrease in church attendance and the macro political shift away from religious influence over the past 20+ years. Gallup has measured U.S membership of any religious institution since 1937, and the percentage has remained around 70%, until the turn of the 21st century, and last measured at 47% in 2020. Gallup reports that the decline in religious membership between 2000 to 2020 is similar across all religions, with steeper declines seen among Catholics. However, they attribute most of the decline to overall decline in religious affiliation (less affiliation to a religion, less membership to a religious institution). My goal in this study is to attribute further causation to this religious decline, and my first target is science/technology. The world has experienced other phenomena over the past century (i.e. massive increases in the middle-class and globalization), but based on personal experience, I believe progress made in the fields of science has contributed most significantly; archaeological discoveries have contradicted historical claims of the church, and ease-of-access to technologies which promise to make our lives better deter people from values of humility often preached by religious figures. 

The U.S. has experienced a tremendous decline in religious participation, from 73% in 1973 to 47% in 2020, based on a Gallup report. I chose the WVS and NPORs surveys because these were conducted by huge research organizations with large enough sample sizes for the desired analysis, and the breadth of question topics is also wide-ranging. My approach to analyzing the data was make it easier to work with, examine the descriptive statistics, then apply the appropriate model. To make the data easier to work with, I categorized many of the questions, reencoded null values, selected the variables of interest, and dichotomized our key variables. The exploratory data analysis provided insight into the distribution of our key variables and helped with the recoding. Since the goal is to assess the statistical significance of any difference in the proportions of two groups, it makes sense to use a 2-proportion z-test.

# About the Data - WVS Wave 7

The data used for this project comes from Wave 7 of the World Values Survey. The data and its documentation can be found in a variety of formats through the following link:

[WVS Wave 7](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp)

```


# Data Tidying

**The WVS data requires a bit of processing before we can begin analysis.**

In this section, I select a range of questions and add category names to them based on the questionnaire guide on the WVS website. I confirmed there were no null values, because for every variable there either shouldn't be null values or they are encoded as negative numbers. I am also removing `q172r` because it is a less granular version of `q172` that is recoded post-survey. Lastly, I recoded the negative values for the questions as NA, so the data will be easier to work with later on.

First, I am filtering to only respondents in the U.S. and selecting our target variables.

```{r message=FALSE}
# Select data of interest
wvs_data <- wvs_survey |>     
  filter(B_COUNTRY == 840) |>        #U.S. country code
  select(Q44, Q50, Q173) |> 
  rename(science = Q44,              #proxy for science approval
         econ_outlook = Q50,         #proxy for economic outlook
         religion = Q173)            #proxy for religious affiliation
```

Next, I nee

```{r}
wvs_data |> 
  filter(if_any(everything(), is.na)) |> 
  count()

#wvs_data <- wvs_data |> 
 # mutate(across(4:126, \(x) ifelse(x < 0, NA, x)))

```

# Clean Data

```{r}
#Minimize dataset so it's faster
us_sci_religion <- wvs_survey |>     
  filter(B_COUNTRY == 840) |>        #U.S. country code
  select(Q44, Q173) |> 
  rename(science = Q44,              #proxy for science approval
         religion = Q173)            #proxy for religious affiliation

#Observe values in science column
us_sci_religion |> 
  count(science)

#Observe values in religion column
us_sci_religion |> 
  count(religion)

#Recode neutral and null responses to NA
us_sci_religion <- us_sci_religion |> 
  mutate(science = as.character(science),
         science = case_when(science == -2 ~ NA,
                             science == -1 ~ NA,
                             science == 1 ~ "good",
                             science == 2 ~ NA,
                             science == 3 ~ "bad",
                             .default = science),
         religion = as.character(religion),
         religion = case_when(religion == -2 ~ NA,
                              religion ==1 ~ "yes",
                              religion == 2 ~ "no",
                              religion == 3 ~ "no",
                              .default = religion))
```

# Summary Statistics

Within our science variable we can a huge skew in approval in favor of science development being "good". Within the religion variable, the proportion seems close to what was reported by Gallop (47%).

```{r}
#Compute a proportion table grouped by science
us_sci_religion |> 
  drop_na(science, religion) |> 
  group_by(science, religion) |> 
  count() |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  mutate(science_sum = n + lag(n, 1),
         science_group_sum = case_when(is.na(science_sum) ~ 158,
                                 science_sum == 779 ~ 1417,
                                 .default = science_sum),
         prop_science = round(n/science_sum, 2)) |> 
  select(1:3, 5)

#Distribution of responses for science
science_bar <- us_sci_religion |> 
  drop_na(science) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = science)) +
  geom_bar()

#Distribution of responses for religion
religion_bar <- us_sci_religion |> 
  drop_na(religion) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = religion)) +
  geom_bar()

ggarrange(science_bar, religion_bar)
```

# Hypothesis Test

### Conditions for the Sampling Distribution of Two Proportions

In order to validate the use of a sampling distribution of two proportions, our variables must meet two conditions: independence within and between groups and the success-failure condition. Since this survey was a simple, random sample, independence is met. To satisfy the success-failure condition, we must find the np and n(1-p) to be greater than 10 within all groups. All groups satisfy this condition.

```{r}
set.seed(606)

#science bad, not religious
62*.39

#science bad, yes religious
96*.61

#science good, not religious
683*.48

#science good, yes religious
734*.52

```

### Testing the Difference of Two Proportions

In this section, we run a test to see if there's a statistically significant difference in the proportions of religious people in the science approval and disapproval groups. We can see in the visualization that our observed statistic is in the outskirts of the null distribution. Our p-value is 0.036, so we reject our null hypothesis.

```{r message=FALSE}
#Calculate difference in proportions
#science bad & yes religious vs science good and yes religious
0.61-0.52

#Calculate Observed Statistic
p_hat <- us_sci_religion |>  
  drop_na(science, religion) |> 
  specify(religion ~ science, success = "yes") |> 
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("good", "bad"))

#Generate null distribution
null_dist <- us_sci_religion %>%
  drop_na(science, religion) |> 
  specify(religion ~ science, success = "yes") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("good", "bad"))

visualize(null_dist) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = p_hat, direction = "two-sided")

#Get p-value for test
null_dist |> 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = p_hat, direction = "two-sided")

```
